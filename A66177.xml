            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is with great Satisfaction that I Meet you here this Day, being Aſſured of a Good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in My Parliament, when I have had ſuch full Proofs of the Affection of My Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by their Behaviour during My Abſence, and at My Return.</p>
            <p>I was Engaged in the preſent War by the Advice of My Firſt Parliament; who thought it Neceſſary for the Defence of Our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the Preſervation of the Liberties of <hi>Europe.</hi> The Laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, with great Cheerfulneſs, did Aſſiſt Me to Carry it on; and I cannot Doubt, but that your Concern for the Common Safety will Oblige you to be Unanimouſly Zealous in the Proſecution of it. And I am Glad, That the Advantages which We have had this Year, give Us a Reaſonable Ground of Hoping for further Succeſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>Upon this Occaſion, I cannot but take Notice of the Courage and Bravery the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops have ſhewn this laſt Summer, which I may ſay, has anſwered their higheſt Character in any Ager: And it will not be denied, That without the Concurrence of the Valour and Power of <hi>England,</hi> it were impoſſible to put a Stop to the Ambition and Greatneſs of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>I Think it a great Misfortune, that from the Beginning of My Reign, I have been forced to ask ſo many and ſuch large Aids of My People; and yet I am Confident you will agree with Me in Opinion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62205:3"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 27 -->That there will be at leaſt as Great Supplies requiſite for Carrying on the War by Sea and Land this Years, as was Granted in the laſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the rather becauſe Our Enemies are Augmenting their Troops, and the Neceſſity of Increaſing Our Shipping does plainly appear.</p>
               <p>The Fonds which have been Given, have proved very Deficient.</p>
               <p>The Condition of the Civil Liſt is ſuch, That it will not be poſſible for Me to Subſiſt, unleſs that Matter be taken into your Care.</p>
               <p>And Compaſſion Obliges Me to Mention the miſerable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtand, who Suffer for their Religion.</p>
               <p>And therefore, Gentlemen, I moſt earneſtly Recommend to you, to Provide a Supply ſuitable to theſe ſeveral Occaſions.</p>
               <p>I muſt likewiſe take Notice of a great Difficulty We lie under at this time, by Reaſon of the ill State of the Coin; the Redreſs of which, may perhaps prove a further Charge to the Nation: But this is a Matter of ſo general Concern, and of ſo very great Importance, That I have thought fit to leave it intirely to the Conſideration of My Parliament.</p>
               <p>I did Recommend to the laſt Parliament, the Forming ſome Good Bill for the Incouragement and Increaſe of Seam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. I hope you will not let this Seſſion paſs without doing ſomewhat in it, and that you will conſider of ſuch Laws as may be Proper for the Advancement of Trade, and will have a particular Regard to that of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> leſt it ſhould be loſt to the Nation. And while the War makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have an Army Abroad, I could wiſh ſome Way might be thought of, to Raiſe the neceſſary Recruits, without giving Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Complaint.</p>
               <p>My Deſire to Meet My People in a New Parliament, has made the Opening of this Seſſion very late; which, I Hope, you will have ſuch Regard to, as to make all poſſible Diſpatch of the great Buſineſs before you, and will call to Mind, That by the long Continuance of the laſt Seſſion, We did not only loſe Advantages which We might have had at the Beginning of the Campaign, but gave the Enemy ſuch an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, as might have proved very Fatal to Us. And I am the more Concerned to Preſs this, becauſe of the great Preparations which the <hi>French</hi> make to be Early in the Field this Year.</p>
